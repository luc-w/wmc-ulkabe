# Working Memory Capacity Tests

In this repository, we provide the working memory capacity test battery described in this article:

B. Goecke, L. Zimny, J. Hartung, P. Lösche, J. Golle, and O. Wilhelm, “Measuring Cognitive Ability in Children and Adolescents: Development and Validation of a New Test Battery for Working Memory Capacity,” Psychological Test Adaptation and Development, vol. 5, pp. 316–336, Dec. 2024, doi: [10.1027/2698-1866/a000089](https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/10.1027/2698-1866/a000089).

To run the tests, you will need an [Inquisit] (Version 6.6.1) license. Inquisit has a 30 day trial period during which it is fully functional.
