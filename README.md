# Working Memory Capacity Tests

In this repository, we provide the working memory capacity test battery described in this article on [PsyArxiv]:

Goecke, B., Zimny, L., Hartung, J., LÃ¶sche, P., Golle, J., Wilhelm, O. (2023). *Measuring Cognitive Ability From Young Age: Development and Validation of a new Test Battery for Working Memory Capacity.* PsyArXiv. [https://doi.org/xxx/](https://doi.org/xxx/)

To run the tests, you will need an [Inquisit] (Version 6.6.1) license. Inquisit has a 30 day trial period during which it is fully functional.
